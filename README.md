Connect Four stands as a captivating two-player connection game where participants make an initial selection of a color before engaging in the strategic exchange of colored discs. These discs are dropped one by one from the top into a suspended grid with seven columns and six rows. Each piece fall straight down, settling into the next available space within its designated column.
The main goal in this game is to be the first to create a line of four of your own discs, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally .
This project is an integral part of my Core Java training, which I successfully completed through Internshala."
